I see you're trying to install llama-cpp-python but running into SSL certificate verification issues while trying to build cmake as a dependency. This is a common issue on Windows systems, particularly in MSYS2/UCRT64 environments.
Here are a few approaches to resolve this:

First try installing cmake separately using pacman (since you're using MSYS2):

bashCopypacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake

Then try installing llama-cpp-python again, but with the --trusted-host flag:

bashCopypip install llama-cpp-python --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
If that doesn't work, you can try this alternative approach:

Install the required certificates:

bashCopypacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ca-certificates

Set the SSL certificate path:

bashCopyexport SSL_CERT_DIR=/ucrt64/ssl/certs
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/ucrt64/ssl/cert.pem

Then try the installation again:

bashCopypip install llama-cpp-python
If you're still having issues, you could also try installing from source:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python.git
cd llama-cpp-python
pip install .
Let me know which approach you try and if you run into any other errors.
